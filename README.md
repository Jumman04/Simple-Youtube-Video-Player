# Simple YouTube Video Player for Android

Simple YouTube Video Player is an Android app designed to showcase the usage of the YouTube iframe JavaScript player within a mobile application. This demonstration is intended for educational purposes and serves as a basic example of integrating YouTube video playback into an Android app.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide developers with an educational resource for understanding how to incorporate the YouTube iframe JavaScript player into Android applications for basic video playback.

## Best YouTube Player Integration
For the best examples of YouTube player integration and customization, I have developed two feature-rich Android apps:

1. **Global Music Tube**
    - See which music video is trending right now, which song is being played the most,
   - Explore music world wide with World Music Tube! Explore a variety of songs here. Easily find out what people around the world are listening to right now, which song is popular in which country with this app.

   - [View on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mamomi_soft_heart.worldmusictube)

3. **Bangla Natok & Somahar**
   - We have added the popular Natok of all talented artist of Bangladesh here.

These apps demonstrate advanced customization options and enhanced user experiences for YouTube video playback on Android. By exploring these apps, you can see firsthand how I can integrate and customize YouTube players to meet your specific requirements.
